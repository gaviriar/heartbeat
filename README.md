# ArgParser: Measuring heart rate using remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)

[![N|Solid](https://s12.postimg.org/gh7ymb02h/Logo.jpg)](https://github.com/prouast/heartbeat)

This is a simple implementation of rPPG, a way to measure heart rate without skin contact. It uses a video recording or live feed of the face to analyse subtle changes in skin color.

Here's how it works:

  - The face is detected and continuously tracked
  - Signal series is obtained by determining the facial color in every frame
  - Heart rate is estimated using frequency analysis and filtering of the series

If you are interested in the specifics, feel free to have a read of our publications on the topic:

### Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run HeartBeat:

* [OpenCV]
* [G3Log] - needs to be installed

They must be installed on the system such that headers and libraries are found on the compiler's standard search path.

### Installation

Compile the source code for your system, providing a number of required linker flags.
This works with opencv 3.4.1 on macOS:

```sh
$ g++ -std=c++11 -lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgcodecs -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_objdetect -lopencv_video -lopencv_videoio -lavcodec ArgParser.cpp opencv.cpp RPPG.cpp Baseline.cpp -o ArgParser
```

Alternative compilation for Ubuntu. Works with opencv 3.1:
```sh
$ g++ -std=c++11 ArgParser.cpp opencv.cpp RPPG.cpp Baseline.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv` -o ArgParser
```

or using CMake

```sh
mkdir build
cmake ..
make
```
